## UX 

#### Project Goals

The main goal of Whacka-mole is to give the user a fun, intuitive and addictive game with a growing level of difficulty as the game progresses.

#### User Goals

The players goals:
- An entertaining game that can help pass time.
- Nice images and sounds responsive to actions made by the user.
- Becomes more challenging the further the user gets in the game.
- Easily understood and intuitive to play.

#### Developer Goals

- Build a small game that I would enjoy playing to past the time and also challenge myself.
- Write clean code using JavaScript and jQuery to allow the game to function without issues and also allow others to see how the code works with inline comments on block of code.
- Create a new project to add to my portfolio to showcase my ability.

#### User Stories

As the user of this application I want:
1. To have instructions on how to play the game and what the rules may be.
2. The ability to mute any sounds that would be playing in the background.
3. To be able to see my current and high score.
4. increase the level of difficulty as the I progress through the game.
5. A visually appealing game.
6. The ability to play this game on multiple devices.

### Design choices

**Colors**

- The theme of this game revolves heavily around moles and my aim was to achieve an earthy look and feel with the color scheme.

**Styling**

**Background**

- The background image/colors used were to help make the game feel like it is played on the ground with the moles digging underneath the soil and popping up before being bonked on the head.

**Sprites**

- The game uses two mole Sprites. The first sprite is an innocent looking mole that appears from within the hole and the second sprite is used for when the user hits the mole to the give effect the mole has be bonked.

**Audio files**

- Audio plays in the background as the user starts the game as without the audio the game feels very one dimensional, the audio adds some sub-conscious entertainment and keeps the player more immersed.

- A snippet of audio that plays when the user hits a mole before they re-enter the hole to add a feeling of success and allow the user to acknowledge that they hit a mole correctly.
